# ICS-240-Assignment-2

Objective
In this assignment, you are asked to implement a sorted collection called ThingSortedArraySet
where Thing is a class that represents an object of your choice. The collection implements the set
semantics which means it does not allow duplicates.  
Requirements  
Part 1: Implement your Thing class  
Start by choosing what sort of list you would like to keep. For example: 
• Vacation and travel information  
• Real estate properties  
• pretty much any sort of list  
You can be creative about your list. It is prohibited to use grocery items, circles, lines, persons,
cars, students, book, bank accounts, points in two-dimensional space, Movies, Pet, Animal, or
songs. Please note that you will reuse your Thing class across more than one programming
assignment, so try to choose something that interests you.  
Your Thing class must have the following characteristics:  
• has a meaningful name (not Thing).  
• has exactly 2 instance variables such that:  
o one instance variable must be String and this variable will be used as a search key.  
o one instance variable must be int and this variable will be used to find aggregate  
information about Things that are stored in the collection class as will be explained
later.  
• All instance variables must be declared as private.  
• Implement a constructor for your Thing class that takes two input parameters to initialize
the two instance variables. The order of the input parameters must be as follows String,
then int.
